    <h3>A magnificent white chicken lasagna</h3>
    <p>What I'm about to share with you is one of my family's most treasured recipes.</p>
    <p>It is so delicious that they will be furious that I have dared to share it on the Internet.</p>
    <p>However, it is so good that I refuse to keep this knowledge to myself.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2 cups of shredded cooked chicken</li>
        <li>14 ounces of artichoke in water, drained</li>
        <li>8 ounces of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of grated Parmesa cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes pacjed in oil, drained and chopped</li>
        <li>16 ounces of cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup of milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
        <li>8 ounces of mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 175 degrees</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Mix chicken, artichokes, shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese, milk, 1 tablespoon basil, and garlic powder together in a bowl until smooth. Mix 2/3 of the cream cheese mixture with the chicken mixture. Spread remaining cream cheese mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Spread a single layer of lasagna noodles over the cream cheese mixture, top with 1/3 of the chicken mixture, and a layer of mozzarella cheese slices. Repeat layering with noodles, chicken mixture, and mozzarella slices 2 times. Top with remaining Parmesan cheese and basil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbling, about 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
